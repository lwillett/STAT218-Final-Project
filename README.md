# Predicting Wildfire Size Class Across the Continental U.S.
This is a final project for STAT218 in which I explore whether we can predict how large a wildfire will become using only basic information: when and where it starts. 
I learned and implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and compared to other modeling techniques to assess how well they perform with these simple inputs, and whether they could help with early wildfire response.
